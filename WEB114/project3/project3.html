        <h3>When would you use a do while or switch statement in your projects?</h3>
        <p>
            You would use a do while loop to execute a batch of code at least once, then carry on if the condition is truthy. 
            You would use a switch statement to test a bunch of different cases on one thing, whether it be a comparison like (x > 0) or just the value of x.
            The benefit of using a switch is readability; it is a little easier to read a switch statement than a bunch of if else statements.
